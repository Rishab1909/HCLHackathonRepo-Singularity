Andriy Burkov xviii Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 What is Machine Learning Machine learning is a subﬁeld of computer science that is concerned with building algorithms which, to be useful, rely on a collection of examples of some phenomenon. These examples can come from nature, be handcrafted by humans or generated by another algorithm. Machine learning can also be deﬁned as the process of solving a practical problem by 1) gathering a dataset, and 2) algorithmically building a statistical model based on that dataset. That statistical model is assumed to be used somehow to solve the practical problem. To save keystrokes, I use the terms “learning” and “machine learning” interchangeably. 1.2 Types of Learning Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement. 1.2.1 Supervised Learning Insupervised learning1, the dataset is the collection of labeled examples {(xi,yi)}N i=1. Each element xiamongNis called a feature vector. A feature vector is a vector in which each dimension j= 1,...,D contains a value that describes the example somehow. That value is called a feature and is denoted as x(j). For instance, if each example xin our collection represents a person, then the ﬁrst feature, x(1), could contain height in cm, the 1If a term is in bold, that means that the term can be found in the index at the end of the book. second feature, x(2), could contain weight in kg, x(3)could contain gender, and so on. For all examples in the dataset, the feature at position jin the feature vector always contains the same kind of information. It means that if x(2) icontains weight in kg in some example xi, thenx(2) kwill also contain weight in kg in every example xk,k= 1,...,N. The labelyican be either an element belonging to a ﬁnite set of classes{1,2,...,C}, or a real number, or a more complex structure, like a vector, a matrix, a tree, or a graph. Unless otherwise stated, in this bookyiis either one of a ﬁnite set of classes or a real number2. You can see a class as a category to which an example belongs. For instance, if your examples are email messages and your problem is spam detection, then you have two classes {spam,not _spam}.

There are strategies allowing to turn a binary classiﬁcation learning algorithm into a multiclass one. I talk about one of them in Chapter 7. Regression is a problem of predicting a real-valued label (often called a target ) given an unlabeled example. Estimating house price valuation based on house features, such as area, the number of bedrooms, location and so on is a famous example of regression. The regression problem is solved by a regression learning algorithm that takes a collection of labeled examples as inputs and produces a model that can take an unlabeled example as input and output a target. 2.8 Model-Based vs. Instance-Based Learning Most supervised learning algorithms are model-based. We have already seen one such algorithm: SVM. Model-based learning algorithms use the training data to create a model that has parameters learned from the training data. In SVM, the two parameters we saw were w∗andb∗. After the model was built, the training data can be discarded. Instance-based learning algorithms use the whole dataset as the model. One instance-based algorithm frequently used in practice is k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). In classiﬁcation, to predict a label for an input example the kNN algorithm looks at the close neighborhood of the input example in the space of feature vectors and outputs the label that it saw the most often in this close neighborhood. 3There’s still one label per example though. 2.9 Shallow vs. Deep Learning Ashallow learning algorithm learns the parameters of the model directly from the features of the training examples. Most supervised learning algorithms are shallow. The notorious exceptions are neural network learning algorithms, speciﬁcally those that build neural networks with more than one layer between input and output. Such neural networks are called deep neural networks. In deep neural network learning (or, simply, deep learning ), contrary to shallow learning, most model parameters are learned not directly from the features of the training examples, but from the outputs of the preceding layers. Don’t worry if you don’t understand what that means right now. We look at neural networks more closely in Chapter 6. Chapter 3 Fundamental Algorithms In this chapter, I describe ﬁve algorithms which are not just the most known but also either very effective on their own or are used as building blocks for the most effective learning algorithms out there. 3.1 Linear Regression Linear regression is a popular regression learning algorithm that learns a model which is a linear combination of features of the input example. 3.1.1 Problem Statement We have a collection of labeled examples {(xi,yi)}N i=1, whereNis the size of the collection, xiis theD-dimensional feature vector of example i= 1,...,N,yiis a real-valued1target\n\n[Chunk 13 | score:0.525 | source:Andriy Burkov - The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book-Andriy Burkov (2019).pdf]\nmachine learning is a universally recognized term that usually refers to the science and engineering of building machines capable of doing various useful things without being explicitly programmed to do so. So, the word “learning” in the term is used by analogy with the learning in animals rather than literally. Who This Book is For This book contains only those parts of the vast body of material on machine learning developed since the 1960s that have proven to have a signiﬁcant practical value. A beginner in machine learning will ﬁnd in this book just enough details to get a comfortable level of understanding of the ﬁeld and start asking the right questions. xvii Practitioners with experience can use this book as a collection of directions for further self- improvement. The book also comes in handy when brainstorming at the beginning of a project, when you try to answer the question whether a given technical or business problem is “machine-learnable” and, if yes, which techniques you should try to solve it. How to Use This Book If you are about to start learning machine learning, you should read this book from the beginning to the end. (It’s just a hundred pages, not a big deal.) If you are interested in a speciﬁc topic covered in the book and want to know more, most sections have a QR code. QR CodeBy scanning one of those QR codes with your phone, you will get a link to a page on the book’s companion wiki theMLbook.com with additional materials: recommended reads, videos, Q&As, code snippets, tutorials, and other bonuses.

The book does not assume any high level mathematical or statistical training, or even programming experience, so should be accessible to almost anyone willing to invest the time to learn about these methods. It should certainly be required reading for anyone starting a PhD program in this area and will serve as a useful reference as they progress further. Finally, the book illustrates some of the algorithms using Python code, one of the most popular coding languages for machine learning. I would highly recommend “The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book” for both the beginner looking to learn more about machine learning, and the experienced practitioner seeking to extend their knowledge base. Gareth James, Professor of Data Sciences and Operations at University of Southern California, co-author (with Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani), of the best-selling book An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R xvi Preface Let’s start by telling the truth: machines don’t learn. What a typical “learning machine” does, is ﬁnding a mathematical formula, which, when applied to a collection of inputs (called “training data”), produces the desired outputs. This mathematical formula also generates the correct outputs for most other inputs (distinct from the training data) on the condition that those inputs come from the same or a similar statistical distribution as the one the training data was drawn from. Why isn’t that learning? Because if you slightly distort the inputs, the output is very likely to become completely wrong. It’s not how learning in animals works. If you learned to play a video game by looking straight at the screen, you would still be a good player if someone rotates the screen slightly. A machine learning algorithm, if it was trained by “looking” straight at the screen, unless it was also trained to recognize rotation, will fail to play the game on a rotated screen. So why the name “machine learning” then? The reason, as is often the case, is marketing: Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the ﬁeld of computer gaming and artiﬁcial intelligence, coined the term in 1959 while at IBM. Similarly to how in the 2010s IBM tried to market the term “cognitive computing” to stand out from competition, in the 1960s, IBM used the new cool term “machine learning” to attract both clients and talented employees. As you can see, just like artiﬁcial intelligence is not intelligence, machine learning is not learning. However, machine learning is a universally recognized term that usually refers to the science and engineering of building machines capable of doing various useful things without being explicitly programmed to do so. So, the word “learning” in the term is used by analogy with the learning in animals rather than literally.\n\n[Chunk 45 | score:0.500 | source:Andriy Burkov - The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book-Andriy Burkov (2019).pdf]\nexpect numerical features. In the next chapter, I show how to convert categorical features into numerical ones. Some algorithms, like SVM, allow the data analyst to provide weightings for each class. These weightings inﬂuence how the decision boundary is drawn. If the weight of some class is high, the learning algorithm tries to not make errors in predicting training examples of this class (typically, for the cost of making an error elsewhere). That could be important if instances of some class are in the minority in your training data, but you would like to avoid misclassifying examples of that class as much as possible. Some classiﬁcation models, like SVM and kNN, given a feature vector only output the class. Others, like logistic regression or decision trees, can also return the score between 0and1 which can be interpreted as either how conﬁdent the model is about the prediction or as the probability that the input example belongs to a certain class4. Some classiﬁcation algorithms (like decision tree learning, logistic regression, or SVM) build the model using the whole dataset at once. If you have got additional labeled examples, you have to rebuild the model from scratch. Other algorithms (such as Naïve Bayes, multilayer per- ceptron, SGDClassiﬁer/SGDRegressor, PassiveAggressiveClassiﬁer/PassiveAggressiveRegressor in scikit-learn) can be trained iteratively, one batch at a time. Once new training examples are available, you can update the model using only the new data. Finally, some algorithms, like decision tree learning, SVM, and kNN can be used for both clas- siﬁcation and regression, while others can only solve one type of problem: either classiﬁcation or regression, but not both. Usually, each library provides the documentation that explains what kind of problem each algorithm solves, what input values are allowed and what kind of output the model produces. The documentation also provides information on hyperparameters. 4If it’s really necessary, the score for SVM and kNN predictions could be synthetically created using simple techniques. Chapter 5 Basic Practice Until now, I only mentioned in passing some issues that a data analyst needs to consider when working on a machine learning problem: feature engineering, overﬁtting, and hyperparameter tuning. In this chapter, we talk about these and other challenges that have to be addressed before you can type model = LogisticRegression().ﬁt(x,y) in scikit-learn. 5.1 Feature Engineering When a product manager tells you “We need to be able to predict whether a particular customer will stay with us. Here are the logs of customers’ interactions with our product for ﬁve years.” you cannot just grab the data, load it into a library and get a prediction. You need to build a dataset ﬁrst.

Finally, some algorithms, like decision tree learning, SVM, and kNN can be used for both clas- siﬁcation and regression, while others can only solve one type of problem: either classiﬁcation or regression, but not both. Usually, each library provides the documentation that explains what kind of problem each algorithm solves, what input values are allowed and what kind of output the model produces. The documentation also provides information on hyperparameters. 4If it’s really necessary, the score for SVM and kNN predictions could be synthetically created using simple techniques. Chapter 5 Basic Practice Until now, I only mentioned in passing some issues that a data analyst needs to consider when working on a machine learning problem: feature engineering, overﬁtting, and hyperparameter tuning. In this chapter, we talk about these and other challenges that have to be addressed before you can type model = LogisticRegression().ﬁt(x,y) in scikit-learn. 5.1 Feature Engineering When a product manager tells you “We need to be able to predict whether a particular customer will stay with us. Here are the logs of customers’ interactions with our product for ﬁve years.” you cannot just grab the data, load it into a library and get a prediction. You need to build a dataset ﬁrst. Remember from the ﬁrst chapter that the dataset is the collection of labeled\n\n\nQuestion: what are types of machine learning\n\nAnswer (concise, cite chunk ids):"}
